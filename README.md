## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jai Tyagi and I am passionate about Open Source and project developement. Currently I am doing research in Antenna Designing, you can see my research work and progress here:
[Antenna-Designing-for-Cellular-devices](https://github.com/Jai132/Antenna-Designing-for-Cellular-devices/tree/master)

I also have a deep interest in ML, DL and ComputerVision and I am currently developing my skillset so I can make and contribute to some wonderful and exciting projects.

Although I dont have much to show right now ðŸ˜…, but here are my stats anyways:
